      It's Right here under my right set of ribs
  utter_painType:
  - text: |
      It came gradually
      It was a gradual onsent and just got worse

      It's more of a burning pain Doctor

  - text: |
      I'm also having a bit of vomiting
  - text: |
      I feel both nausea and vomit sometimes
  utter_painChange:
  - text: |
      I can't tell if anything relieves the pain
  - text: |
      None of that makes a difference
      The pain remains the same either way
  utter_painNature:
  - text: |
      I can't tell, it's just so uncomfortable and unsettling. It comes and goes as it likes
  - text: |
      The pain is not good, I'd give it a 7 on the scale of 1 - 10
  utter_hematesisMain:
  - text: |
      Yes, I have vomited, and it was all blood stained. That's when I knew something was really wrong Doc. I mean, the vomit was enough to fill a cup
  - text: |
      Yes. the vomit, it even had blood clots and it was a lot. Enough to fill a cup
  utter_hematesisMore:
  - text: |
      The vomiting happens mostly after meals, just everything. Plus I do feel some nausea right before
  - text: |
      Mazee, it just ain't it. After meals I feel nausea and end up vomiting everything.

      Actually, when I pass stool it happens to be dark brown to black
  - text: |
      My stool is all normal, that's if brown is the normal colour
  utter_stoolBlack:
  - text: |
      It started when I was vomiting blood
  - text: |
      Yesterday Doc, when i realized my symptoms were serious.

  - text: |
      Nope, if there was then maybe I didn't notice

      No Doctor, I dont drink
